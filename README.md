# Take a Break

Remind yourself to take a break for a while away from computer.

## Description

I noticed how easy it is to lose track of time when using a computer, which can lead to eye strain, back discomfort, and forgetting simple habits like drinking water.

To help with that, I built this Chrome extension. It sends gentle reminders to pause, stretch, and shift your focus away from the screen at regular intervals. By default, it follows the idea behind the "[How Does the 20-20-20 Rule Prevent Eye Strain?](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#:~:text=What's%20the%2020%2D20%2D20,a%20total%20of%2020%20seconds.) — taking a break every 20 minutes to rest your eyes — but you can adjust the timing to match your own routine.

This tool is designed to support healthier screen use by encouraging short breaks, improving posture, and promoting hydration throughout the day.

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).
