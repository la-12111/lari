## Description

Spending long hours in front of a computer screen is something almost all of us do nowadays. Whether it’s for work, study, or even leisure, it’s very easy to sit down at the computer and suddenly realize that hours have gone by. Unfortunately, this habit comes with side effects: eye strain, back and neck discomfort, mental fatigue, and the tendency to forget simple but essential routines such as standing up, stretching, and even drinking enough water throughout the day.  

I noticed this problem in my own daily life. I often sat down to complete “just one more task” and then found myself sitting for several hours without pause. Over time, my eyes felt dry and tired, my shoulders grew stiff, and I developed the unhealthy tendency to ignore my own body’s signals. That’s when I realized I needed a practical tool that could interrupt this cycle and remind me to prioritize my health.  

To help with that, I created **Take a Break**, a Chrome extension designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind. The extension sends gentle reminders at regular intervals, encouraging you to pause, stretch, and shift your focus away from the screen. The goal is not to interrupt your productivity but to enhance it by ensuring your body and mind are not overworked. By default, the extension follows the idea behind the “[20-20-20 Rule](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#:~:text=What's%20the%2020%2D20%2D20,a%20total%20of%2020%20seconds.)” — every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This simple guideline helps rest your eyes and significantly reduces strain. Of course, the extension allows you to adjust the timing so you can adapt it to your personal routine.  

This tool was not built just as a productivity hack; it was designed with long-term wellness in mind. Taking short breaks during computer use can:  

- Improve posture by encouraging you to stand up and stretch.  
- Reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries such as wrist and neck pain.  
- Help maintain hydration by reminding you to drink water during breaks.  
- Support better focus, since brief pauses allow your brain to recharge.  
- Encourage balance between screen time and mindful moments away from technology.  

By combining these small but consistent actions, **Take a Break** becomes more than just a digital reminder — it becomes a habit-building tool that supports healthier work and study sessions.  

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for [Harvard’s CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x). The project represents both my learning journey in computer science and my commitment to building tools that solve real problems in everyday life. CS50 challenged me to think critically about design, usability, and problem-solving. Creating this extension was a way to merge technical knowledge with personal needs, and it became one of the most rewarding experiences of the course.
